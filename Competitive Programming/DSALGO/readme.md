## Submissiom Guidelines

- Follow the **camelCase** Paradigm for naming your files.
- Save your files in the directories assigned for particular language.
- Algorithms containing Graphs must be located in the sub directory [Graphs](https://github.com/1gne0u5/Learning-Resources/tree/master/Competitive%20Programming/DSALGO/C/Graphs) under the specific programming language.
- For Algorithms involving two Data Structures, they must be saved in both the sub directories of Data Structure they involve.
- New subfolders must be created responsibly leaving no room for confusions.
