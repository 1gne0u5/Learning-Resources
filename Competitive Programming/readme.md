## Submissiom Guidelines

- Name your file as ***name of the problem*** and follow the **camelCase** Paradigm for naming your files.
- Save your files in the designated folders assigned, for example, solutions to CSES Problem Set in the [CSES Directory](https://github.com/1gne0u5/Learning-Resources/tree/master/Competitive%20Programming/Solutions/CSES)
- Solutions to specific types of questions should be saved in particular subfolders, for example, solution to the [Salaries Queries](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1144) problem in [this](https://github.com/1gne0u5/Learning-Resources/tree/master/Competitive%20Programming/Solutions/CSES/Range%20Queries) directory.
- New subfolders must be created responsibly leaving no room for confusions.
