- Solutions to specific types of questions should be saved in particular subfolders, for example, solution to the [Salaries Queries](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1144) problem in [this](https://github.com/1gne0u5/Learning-Resources/tree/master/Competitive%20Programming/Solutions/CSES/Range%20Queries) directory.
