# Mozilla Campus Club

## Celebrates [Hacktoberest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)

If you want to contribute to open source but didn’t know where to start, Hacktoberfest is the perfect opportunity for you. Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software organized by DigitalOcean, Intel, and DEV. The goal of the event is to encourage participation in the open source community all across the globe. And the challenge is simple: open four or more high-quality PRs in October and in any open source project to get a limited edition Hacktoberfest T-shirt. That’s it!

And my favorite part of the event is the community, an excellent mix of experienced contributors willing to collaborate & mentor! But I know that Hacktoberfest can get intimidating really fast. There's a lot to study, a lot to read, and a lot to learn. Help out with Mozilla Campus Club projects Of course, one of our favorite ways for you to participate in Hacktoberfest is by contributing to Mozilla Campus Club projects.

## So, what are these projects?

The team invests a significant amount of effort during the month of October to work with contributors and help solve issues marked with #hacktoberfest tags in the respective projects.
